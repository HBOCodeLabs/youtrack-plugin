Checking this does, that the build bundle will only be updated with new builds if there are builds that should be marked
as fixed for the current build. That is, if we build three build: build 1, build 2 and build 3, and we only issue
commands that marks issues as fixed in build 1 og build 3, then after the three builds the build bundle will only
contain build 1 og build 3.
